# Genshin Companion App - ReactJS

Welcome to Genshin Companion[Placeholder] - ReactJS, an interactive web application designed to provide users with essential information for Mihoyo's popular game, Genshin Impact. This project combines HTML and CSS for the frontend and leverages the power of ReactJS for the backend. It's a personal passion project that I'll be continuously enhancing over time.


## Features (so far)

- Auto-updating character list display on landing page


## Roadmap

- Create static pages with basic information about the game, such as an introduction to Genshin Impact, its gameplay mechanics, and world exploration.

- Display a list of Genshin Impact characters with their basic information, such as name, image, element, and weapon type.

- Similar to the character list, create a page to display a list of weapons with their details.

- Implement individual pages for each character, showing detailed information, stats, abilities, and recommended builds.

- Likewise, create individual pages for each weapon, displaying detailed information, stats, and recommended usage.

- Add a search bar to allow users to search for characters or weapons by name.

- Implement options to filter and sort characters or weapons based on various criteria, such as rarity, element, weapon type, etc.

- Allow users to create accounts, log in, and possibly save their favorite characters, weapons, or builds.

- Create interactive guides for quests, boss fights, resource farming routes, etc. [MAYBE]
- Obligatory Light/Dark mode toggle

Integration with APIs:
- Enable users to track their in-game progress, such as completed quests, collected items, or character levels.

- Explore and integrate additional data from official Genshin Impact APIs, such as live event information or player statistics.
